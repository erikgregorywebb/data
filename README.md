### Marvel Cinematic Universe Films

While re-watching parts of the MCU series during paternity leave, I compiled a dataset measuring things like budget, box office sales, and Rotten Tomatoes rating for the 23 movies. Using this data, I created an interactive visual in Tableau allowing comparison of measures across the films in different orders, like release date and chronological order.
